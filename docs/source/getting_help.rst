Getting Help, Reporting Problems, and Suggesting Enhancements
===============================================================

The easiest way to get help, report a problem, or suggest a PySPEDAS enhancement is to
open an issue on the PySPEDAS GitHub repository:

https://github.com/spedas/pyspedas/issues

If you don't have a GitHub account, or just prefer email, you can contact the PySPEDAS developers
by emailing jwl@ssl.berkeley.edu.

Try to include as much information as possible about your environment (operating system, Python version, PySPEDAS version), what you were trying to do
(code snippet that we can use to reproduce the issue), what you expected to happen, and what actually happened (log output or error messages, system
crashed or stopped responding, plots didn't look right...)
